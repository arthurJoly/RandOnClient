RandOnClient
============

This is the client part of our project Rand'On

How to install the client?

First you need the Java development Kit (JDK) and the Android Development Tools (ADT) and Eclipse.

Once you have installed all of these elements you need to run Eclipse. Then go on Android SDK Manager and download "Tools",
"Andoid 4.4.2 (API 19)" and "Extras". In "Extras" make sure that you download "Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer)".

After you downloaded the Emulator Accelerator you need to run the setup located in: {SDK_FOLDER}\extras\intel\Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager\intelhaxm.exe

Then you can create an Android Emulator with the API "Google APIs (x86 System Image)(Google Inc.) - API 19" by clicking on the Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager.

Once your AVD is working you can just run the application by clicking on the green arrow or going in the run menu and clicking on 
"run as".
You may have to clean (and build) the project before running it.

You can also connect your phone and run the application directly on it. Your phone need to be on Android 4.0.3 or more.
It will be more efficient.
